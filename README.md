# AR-Dinosaur-Museum
Title : AR Dinosaur Museum
Description : 🦕 "Right now, this app focuses on dinosaurs, but it can be extended to historical artifacts, space exploration, underwater creatures, and more. Museums, schools, and even brands can use this technology for immersive experiences."

Features
✅ Basic Features (MVP - Must Have)
🔹 Place Dinosaurs in AR – Users can spawn and interact with realistic 3D dinosaurs.
🔹 Animated Dinosaurs – Dinosaurs should walk, roar, and react to user input.
🔹 Educational Info Panel – Click a dinosaur to learn its name, era, diet, and extinction facts.
🔹 AR Scaling & Movement – Users should be able to rotate, zoom in/out, and move dinosaurs.
🔹 UI Controls – Simple UI for selecting different dinosaurs and changing settings.

🚀 Advanced Features (To Make It Impressive)
🌋 Fossil Scanner Mode – Users scan a fossil image to see the full dinosaur skeleton reconstructed in AR.
🦴 Dinosaur Evolution Timeline – Show how different species evolved over time.
🦖 AR Mini Game Mode – A mode where users can feed dinosaurs or escape from a T-Rex chase.
📸 AR Photo Mode – Users can take pictures with dinosaurs and share on social media.
🔊 Sound & Voice Narration – Add realistic dinosaur sounds and voice explanations.
💡 Museum Mode – A setting where users can switch between Dinosaurs, Space, or Historical Artifacts to show the app’s flexibility.


🎨 UI/UX Design for the AR App
Since this is an AR experience, the UI should be minimal and intuitive. Here’s how:
🔹 Home Screen – A simple welcome page with a “Start AR Museum” button.
🔹 AR Scene – Just essential controls:
	• Dinosaur Selector (Dropdown or Carousel)
	• Info Button (Opens the educational panel)
	• Sound Toggle (Enable/Disable dinosaur roars)
	• Camera Button (For taking AR pictures)
🔹 Educational Panel UI – A sleek card-style popup with dino details and animations.
🔹 Exit & Reset Buttons – A simple way to return to the home screen or restart the experience.
